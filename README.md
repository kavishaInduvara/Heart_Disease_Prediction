#Heart Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. Heart disease is a prevalent health concern worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. The model implemented here utilizes a dataset containing information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors to make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uc. It includes a diverse range of demographic and health-related features, making it suitable for training a robust prediction model for heart disease.

Model
The heart disease prediction model is built , leveraging algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier ,DecisionTreeClassifier ,RandomForestClassifier, which have been proven effective in classification tasks. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage
To utilize the heart disease prediction model:

•	Clone this repository to your local machine.

•	Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

•	Run the provided script predict_heart_disease.py with the required input parameters to obtain predictions for heart disease likelihood.

Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability and robustness. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the model's metrics and performance is provided in the evaluation.ipynb notebook.

Future Improvements
Although the current version of the model shows promising results, there are several avenues for improvement and expansion, such as:

Incorporating additional features or data sources for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms or ensemble techniques.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance further.
